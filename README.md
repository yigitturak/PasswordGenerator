# PasswordGenerator

This password generator application generates a password by using some basic meaningful words/sentences. 

**How it works:**

You can write down a meaningful word/sentence which could be a password for you. But it can be easly cracked by a dictionary attack. This program makes this password stronger by changing letters with numbers and/or special characters.

Then you can encrypt the generated password with a key defined by you and save it.

This is a beta version.
